>The [Small World Initiative® (SWI)](http://www.smallworldinitiative.org/) strives to combine technology, science, and innovation to make meaningful and measurable improvements in the global education and healthcare landscape.
The mission of the program is twofold.
First, it seeks to encourage students to pursue careers in science and increase scientific literacy through real-world applicable laboratory and field research in introductory courses.
Second, it aims to address a worldwide health threat – the diminishing supply of effective antibiotics – by tapping into the collective power of many student researchers concurrently tackling the same challenge, living up to its motto “crowdsourcing antibiotic discovery.”™
