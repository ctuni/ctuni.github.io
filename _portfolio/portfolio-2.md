In today's world, creative professions like emerging fashion designers need to have an Internet presence, a good SEO, and a visually pleasing website, capable of showcasing their designs and transmitting the character of the designer itself. Before this project, my only knowledge of HTML and CSS was very basic (and what is Javascript?!).

Fortunately for me (and for my learning), my partner, who is a fashion designer, needed a website! Thanks to my already existing basic knowledge on web design, I was able to learn by doing her website. 

This process included everything: from domain parking, to hosting, to the design of the responsive website itself. The end product is a website build using the `Substance` Bootstrap website template, Google Domains, and Github Pages.

Since an image is worth a thousand words, and I then guess a website will be worth ten thousand words. Check the result for yourself [here](www.carlacanadell.com)!
