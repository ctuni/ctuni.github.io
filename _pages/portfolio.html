All of the items in this portfolio were passion projects, done for fun, and completely unrelated to my work as a bioinformatics scientist. Of course, I also have fun in my day-to-day work, but since I'm not the sole owner and developer of the bioinformatics scientific projects, those are not in this section but in the <a href="publications.md" target="_blank">Publications</a> page (or are yet to be published).
